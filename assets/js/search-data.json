            "content": ". Overall Strategy . Using the Fast.AI library, I created shallow neural networks to encode all the categorical features of the funding data (company market, city, region, etc.) and then extracted the ebedding layers for further analysis with Machine Learning. . Instead of a simple label encoding of each feature, I created a vector representation. . The sample below shows a vector of length 3. The advantage is that we are able to transform discreet variables into vectors that are continous and meaningful. . &gt; &gt; ### . In the Fast.AI book, Deep Learning for Coders, an excellent example of the benefits of categorical embedding is provided. . On the left is a plot of the embedding matrix for the possible values of the State category. For a categorical variable we call the possible values of the variable its &quot;levels&quot; (or &quot;categories&quot; or &quot;classes&quot;), so here one level is &quot;Berlin,&quot; another is &quot;Hamburg,&quot; etc. On the right is a map of Germany. The actual physical locations of the German states were not part of the provided data, yet the model itself learned where they must be, based only on the behavior of store sales! . . The overall strategy to predict the success (the purchase of the startup) was the following: . Import and clean the data | Create additional features | Run data through multiple shallow neural networks to convert categorical data to continous | Train ML models on the latent space of the neural nets | Ensemble the predictions from each model | Train ML model on the Ensemble | Select the most confident prediction | Ensembling the embeddings . What makes this code unique is the fact that I took the same data and ran it through 4 different shallow neural networks with each network set to a different embedding size. . For each neural net, I extracted the latent layers and trained a Random Forest model on each embedding space and then ensembled the predictions and probabilites. The end result was an improvement of &gt; 6%. . The predictions improve because each model puts an emphasis on the different features. The two charts shown below show the top 10 features based on the importance to the model. Each model analyzes the data differently based on the relative importance of the features. Remember, the underlying data is identical, but I&#39;m analyzing the latent space with different embedding sizes. . . Import the data, split into Training and Test, Split into continous and categorical data . Run data through multiple shallow neural networks to convert categorical to continous data . Train ML models on the latent space of the neural nets . random.seed(1234) models = [ (&#39;RandomForest&#39;, RandomForestClassifier(max_depth=200, random_state=random.seed(1234), oob_score=True, min_samples_split=30)), ] procs_nn = [Categorify, FillMissing, Normalize] to_nn = TabularPandas(df_nn_final, procs_nn, cat_nn, cont_nn, splits=splits, y_names=dep_var) dls = to_nn.dataloaders(512) emb_szs={&#39;city&#39;:1, &#39;market&#39;:1,&#39;region&#39;:1,&#39;founded_month&#39;:1, &#39;founded_quarter&#39;:1,&#39;state_code&#39;:1} _, embeded_xs_1, xs_valid_1 = nn_embeddings(emb_szs) embed_1_df = run_exps(models, embeded_xs_1, y_train, xs_valid_1, y_test, &#39;embed_1&#39;) emb_szs={&#39;city&#39;:2, &#39;market&#39;:2,&#39;region&#39;:2,&#39;founded_month&#39;:2, &#39;founded_quarter&#39;:2,&#39;state_code&#39;:2} _, embeded_xs_2, xs_valid_2 = nn_embeddings(emb_szs) embed_2_df = run_exps(models, embeded_xs_2, y_train, xs_valid_2, y_test, &#39;embed_2&#39;) emb_szs={&#39;city&#39;:3, &#39;market&#39;:3,&#39;region&#39;:3,&#39;founded_month&#39;:3, &#39;founded_quarter&#39;:3,&#39;state_code&#39;:3} _, embeded_xs_3, xs_valid_3 = nn_embeddings(emb_szs) embed_3_df = run_exps(models, embeded_xs_3, y_train, xs_valid_3, y_test, &#39;embed_3&#39;) _, embeded_xs_default, xs_valid_default = nn_embeddings() embed_default_df = run_exps(models, embeded_xs_default, y_train, xs_valid_default, y_test, &#39;default_embedding&#39;) . epoch train_loss valid_loss accuracy time . 0 | 2.105271 | 4.765329 | 0.561782 | 00:00 | . 1 | 2.424031 | 2.302882 | 0.567529 | 00:00 | . 2 | 1.865460 | 27.719856 | 0.564655 | 00:00 | .

Interesting high confidence predictions . I predicted that Kickfire was aquired with a 79% confidence, however the data provided by Crunchbase listed it as a closed. After investigation, Kickfire was actually aquired in 2010 by Teradata. Details can be found in this article. . Similarly, I predicted Color Labs Inc. was aquired, but the data provided said it closed. Apple aquired Color Labs Inc. for $7M in 2012. . The other company that I predicted would get aquired is Breaktime Studios. This company went under in 2016. . While I was able to make accurate predictions on the limited data of market type and the aount of funding in each round. It would have been helpful to know who was making the investments.

This post describes what we learned along the way. . Motivation . Recently, we released ghapi, a new python client for the GitHub API. ghapi provides unparalleled ease of access to the GitHub api, as well as utilities for interacting with GitHub Actions. Part of our motivation for creating ghapi was to accelerate the development of build, testing and deployment tools that help us in maintaining fastai projects. . We recently started using GitHub Actions to perform a wide variety of tasks automatically like: unit and integration tests, deploying documentation, building Docker containers and Conda packages, sharing releases on Twitter, and much more. This automation is key to maintaining the vast open source fastai ecosystem with very few maintainers. . Since ghapi is central to so many of these tasks, we wanted to stress-test its efficacy against other projects. That’s when we found ghtop. This tool allows you to stream all the public events happening on GitHub to a CLI dashboard. We thought it would be a fun learning experience to refactor this code base with various fastai tools such as ghapi and fastcore, but also try out new libraries like rich. . Features we added to our tools . While exploring ghtop, we added several features to various fastai tools that we found to be generally useful. . ghapi Authentication . We added the function github_auth_device which allows users to authenticate their api client with GitHub interactively in a browser. When we call this function we get the following prompt: . github_auth_device() . First copy your one-time code: 276E-C910 Then visit https://github.com/login/device in your browser, and paste the code when prompted. Shall we try to open the link for you? [y/n] . The browser opens a window that looks like this: . . The function then returns an authenticated token which you can use for various tasks. While this is not the only way to create a token, this is a user friendly way to create a token, especially for those who are not as familiar with GitHub. . ghapi Events . As a result of our explorations with ghtop, we added an event module to ghapi. This is useful for retrieving and inspecting sample events. Inspecting sample events is important as it allows you to prototype GitHub Actions workflows locally. You can sample real events with load_sample_events: . from ghapi.event import load_sample_events evts = load_sample_events() . Individual events are formatted as markdown lists to be human readable in Jupyter: . print(evts[0]) . - id: 14517925737 - type: PushEvent - actor: - id: 17030246 - login: BeckhamL - display_login: BeckhamL - gravatar_id: - url: https://api.github.com/users/BeckhamL - avatar_url: https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17030246? - repo: - id: 154349747 - name: BeckhamL/leetcode - url: https://api.github.com/repos/BeckhamL/leetcode - payload: - push_id: 6194986903 - size: 1 - distinct_size: 1 - ref: refs/heads/master - head: 2055b0fcf22f1c3543e38b60199f6882266d32a5 - before: cb16921949c969b5153a0c23ce8fe516d2c8d773 - commits: - - sha: 2055b0fcf22f1c3543e38b60199f6882266d32a5 - author: - email: beckham.lam@mail.mcgill.ca - name: Beckham Lam - message: Create detectCapital.ts - distinct: True - url: https://api.github.com/repos/BeckhamL/leetcode/commits/2055b0fcf22f1c3543e38b60199f6882266d32a5 - public: True - created_at: 2020-12-13T21:32:34Z . You can also inspect the json data in an event, which are accessible as attributes: . evts[0].type . &#39;PushEvent&#39; . For example, here is the frequency of all full_types in the sample: . x,y = zip(*Counter([o.full_type for o in evts]).most_common()) plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6)) plt.barh(x[::-1],y[::-1]); . We can fetch public events in parallel with GhApi.list_events_parallel. In our experiments, repeatedly calling list_events_parallel is fast enough to fetch all current public activity from all users across the entire GitHub platform. We use this for ghtop. Behind the scenes, list_events_parallel uses Python&#39;s ThreadPoolExecutor to fetch events in parallel - no fancy distributed systems or complicated infrastructure necessary, even at the scale of GitHub! . %time api = GhApi() evts = api.list_events_parallel() len(evts) . CPU times: user 2 µs, sys: 0 ns, total: 2 µs Wall time: 4.29 µs . 240 . Note that the GitHub API is stateless, so successive calls to the API will likely return events already seen. We handle this by using a set operations to filter out events already seen. . ghapi pagination . One of the most cumbersome aspects of fetching lots of data from the GitHub api can be pagination. As mentioned in the documentation, different endpoints have different pagination rules and defaults. Therefore, many api clients offer clunky or incomplete interfaces for pagination. . In ghapi we added an entire module with various tools to make paging easier. Below is an example for retrieving repos for the github org. Without pagination, we can only retrieve a fixed number at a time (by default 30): . api = GhApi() repos = api.repos.list_for_org(&#39;fastai&#39;) len(repos) . 30 . However, to get more we can paginate through paged: . from ghapi.event import paged repos = paged(api.repos.list_for_org, &#39;fastai&#39;) for page in repos: print(len(page), page[0].name) . 30 fast-image 30 fastforest 30 .github 8 tweetrel . You can learn more about this functionality by reading the docs. . fastcore Sparklines . Part of goals for refactoring ghtop were to introduce cool visualizations in the terminal of data. We drew inspiration from projects like bashtop, which have CLI interfaces that look like this: . Concretely, we really liked the idea of sparklines in the terminal. Therefore, we created the ability to show sparklines with fastcore: . from fastcore.utils import sparkline data = [9,6,None,1,4,0,8,15,10] print(f&#39;without &quot;empty_zero&quot;: {sparkline(data, empty_zero=False)}&#39;) print(f&#39; with &quot;empty_zero&quot;: {sparkline(data, empty_zero=True )}&#39;) . without &#34;empty_zero&#34;: ▅▂ ▁▂▁▃▇▅ with &#34;empty_zero&#34;: ▅▂ ▁▂ ▃▇▅ . For more information on this function, read the docs. Later in this post, we will describe how we used Rich to add color and animation to these sparklines. . fastcore EventTimer . Because we wanted streaming event data to automatically populate sparklines, we created EventTimer that constructs a histogram according to a frequency and time span you set. With EventTimer, you can add events with add, and get the number of events and their frequency: . from fastcore.utils import EventTimer from time import sleep import random def _randwait(): yield from (sleep(random.random()/200) for _ in range(100)) c = EventTimer(store=5, span=0.03) for o in _randwait(): c.add(1) print(f&#39;Num Events: {c.events}, Freq/sec: {c.freq:.01f}&#39;) print(&#39;Most recent: &#39;, sparkline(c.hist), *L(c.hist).map(&#39;{:.01f}&#39;)) . Num Events: 6, Freq/sec: 301.1 Most recent: ▃▁▁▇▁ 323.6 274.8 291.3 390.9 283.6 . For more information, see the docs. . CLI Animations With Rich . Rich is an amazing python library that allows you to create beautiful, animated and interactive CLI interfaces. Below is a preview of some its features: . Rich also offers animated elements like spinners: . ... and progress bars: . While this post is not about rich, we highly recommend visiting the repo and the docs to learn more. Rich allows you to create your own custom elements. We created two custom elements - Stats and FixedPanel, which we describe below: . Stats: Sparklines with metrics . Stats renders a group of sparklines along with a spinner and a progress bar. First we define our sparklines, the last argument being a list of event types to count: . from ghtop.richext import * from ghtop.all_rich import * console = Console() s1 = ESpark(&#39;Issues&#39;, &#39;green&#39;, [IssueCommentEvent, IssuesEvent]) s2 = ESpark(&#39;PR&#39;, &#39;red&#39;, [PullRequestEvent, PullRequestReviewCommentEvent, PullRequestReviewEvent]) s3 = ESpark(&#39;Follow&#39;, &#39;blue&#39;, [WatchEvent, StarEvent]) s4 = ESpark(&#39;Other&#39;, &#39;red&#39;) s = Stats([s1,s2,s3,s4], store=5, span=.1, stacked=True) console.print(s) . 🌍 Issues PR Follow Other Quota /min 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 ━━━━━━━ 0% .

Here is what the animated version looks like: . . FixedPanel: A panel with fixed height . A key aspect of ghtop is showing events in different panels.
